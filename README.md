# AgriTech: IoT-based Web Application for Smart Agriculture

## Project Overview

AgriTech is an innovative IoT-based web application designed to revolutionize agriculture by leveraging modern technology. This project utilizes the ESP32 microcontroller in conjunction with various sensors to monitor and control soil conditions, ensuring optimal crop growth and resource management.

## Key Components

### 1. ESP32 Microcontroller
The ESP32 is a powerful and versatile microcontroller used as the central unit of the AgriTech system. It is responsible for collecting data from various sensors and transmitting it to the web application for real-time monitoring and control.

### 2. Humidity Sensor
A humidity sensor is integrated into the system to measure the ambient humidity levels. This data is crucial for understanding the environmental conditions that can affect soil moisture and plant health.

### 3. Soil Moisture Sensor
The soil moisture sensor measures the water content in the soil. By providing real-time data on soil moisture levels, it helps in determining the irrigation needs of the crops, preventing over or under-watering.

### 4. Flow Sensor
The flow sensor controls the rate of water flow to the irrigation system. Based on the soil moisture data, the ESP32 adjusts the water flow rate, ensuring efficient water usage and maintaining optimal soil moisture levels.

### 5. Custom-Made Optical NPK Sensor
A custom-made optical NPK sensor is employed to measure the nutrient levels in the soil, specifically nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), and potassium (K). These nutrients are vital for plant growth, and their precise measurement allows for targeted fertilization, enhancing crop yield and quality.

## System Architecture

### Data Collection
The sensors connected to the ESP32 continuously collect data on soil moisture, humidity, water flow, and nutrient levels. 

### Data Transmission
The ESP32 processes the collected data and transmits it to the web application using Wi-Fi connectivity.

### Web Application
The web application provides a user-friendly interface for farmers to monitor real-time data, set thresholds, and control the irrigation system remotely. Alerts and notifications are sent if any parameter goes beyond the set limits, allowing for prompt intervention.

## Benefits of AgriTech

- **Efficient Water Management:** Automated control of water flow based on soil moisture levels reduces water wastage and ensures crops receive the right amount of water.
- **Optimized Fertilization:** Accurate measurement of soil nutrients enables precise fertilization, improving crop health and yield.
- **Remote Monitoring and Control:** The web application allows farmers to monitor and control the system from anywhere, providing convenience and saving time.
- **Sustainability:** By optimizing resource usage, AgriTech promotes sustainable farming practices, reducing the environmental impact of agriculture.

## Conclusion

AgriTech is a cutting-edge solution aimed at transforming traditional farming into a smart, efficient, and sustainable practice. With its advanced sensors and real-time data monitoring, it empowers farmers to make informed decisions, ultimately leading to better crop management and increased productivity.
